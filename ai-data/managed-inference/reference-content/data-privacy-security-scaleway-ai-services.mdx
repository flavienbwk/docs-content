## Data processing by Scaleway AI services

Scaleway's AI services, involve preceise data processing practices and robust security measures to ensure customer data privacy and integrity. Here's a detailed breakdown of these practices:

### Data processed by Managed Inference

1. **Input Data**: Scaleway processes input data such as prompts and parameters provided by the customer to generate the requested content.
2. **Metadata**: It processes metadata associated with the use of Scaleway-owned interfaces like the console and CLI. This metadata helps enhance service performance and improve the overall customer experience.

### Data usage policies

Scaleway's Managed Inference services emphasize privacy and data security by adhering to strict data usage policies:

- **Stateless Models**: Scaleway's models do not retain any prompts or generated content after processing. This means:
  - No prompts or completions are stored within the model.
  - The data is not used for training, retraining, or improving the base models.

- **Data Isolation**: The customer's data, including prompts, completions, embeddings, and training data, remains isolated and secure:
  - **Not available to other customers**: Your data cannot be accessed by other Scaleway customers.
  - **Not accessible by bodel creators**: The data is not accessible to the creators of the underlying large language models (LLMs).
  - **Not used for model improvement**: Data is not used to improve Scaleway or third-party products, services, or models.

- **Service Control and Hosting**: Scaleway maintains full control over the Managed Inference service, hosting the LLMs on its infrastructure without any interaction with third-party services.

### Data Storage Policies

- **Customer Data**: Inputs and outputs processed during inference are considered customer data. Scaleway does not log this data unless explicitly permitted by the customer through an opt-in feature, which is currently unavailable.

### Data Security Measures

- **Encryption**: All traffic between the customer and the inference service is encrypted using in-transit TLS encryption, ensuring data protection during transmission.
- **Endpoint Security**: Public-facing endpoints are secured with API key tokens.
- **Virtual Private Cloud**: The service can be hosted in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) within private subnets. Access to the service can be restricted based on allowed IP ranges.
