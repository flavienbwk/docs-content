This page shows how to connect to your Scaleway Instance via SSH. Thanks to the SSH key that you created and uploaded, you can use a terminal application on your local computer to remotely connect to your Instance as root. This enables you to use your Instance as you wish.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance)

## How to connect to Linux Instances

### How to connect from OSX (Mac) and Linux

1. Open a terminal program.
2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_ed25519`) and `your_instance_ip` with the IP address of your Instance.
    ```sh
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_instance_ip
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
    To find the IP address of your Instance, log into the Scaleway console and
    click **Instances** in the Compute section of the side menu. A list of your
    Instances and their associated IP addresses will display.

    </Message>
3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
    ```
    The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
    ```

    You are now connected to your Instance.

### How to connect from Windows

To connect to your Instance from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTY**, an SSH client.

1. [Download and install PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
2. Launch PuTTY on your computer. The main screen of the application displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-putty-main.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter your Instance's IP address in the **Hostname** field.
    <Message type="tip">
      To find the IP address of your Instance, log into the Scaleway console and
      click **Instances** in the Compute section of the side menu. A list of your
      Instances and their associated IP addresses will display.
    </Message>
4. In the side menu, under **Connection**, navigate to the **Auth** sub-category. Do this by expanding **Connection**, then **SSH**, and finally clicking on **Auth**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-putty-ssh.webp" alt="" />
5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you [generated previously](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/).
6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the Instance. Upon the first connection, PuTTY asks you to allow the connection to the host.
7. Click **OK** to confirm.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-putty-security.webp" alt="" />

    The terminal window displays.
8. Enter the username `root` and press **Enter** to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-putty-logged.webp" alt="" />

    You are now connected to your Instance.

## How to connect to Windows Instances

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the left side menu. The Instances dashboard displays.
2. Click the name of the Instance you want to connect to.
3. Click **Get password** to retrieve the password of your Instance. A popup displays.
4. Click **Browse** and select your private key file or copy and paste your private RSA SSH key in the form. Then click **Validate** to retrieve the password.
5. Your initial Administrator password displays. Copy this password and save it.
6. Launch your Remote Desktop client, enter your Instance's IP address, the username **Administrator** and the initial password to connect.
    <Message type="tip">
      * On Windows PCs you can use the [built-in RDP client](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-use-remote-desktop-5fe128d5-8fb1-7a23-3b8a-41e636865e8c) to connect to your Instance
      * On Mac OS X you can download the [Microsoft RDP client](https://apps.apple.com/en/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466) to connect to your instance
      * On Linux you can use the remote desktop client of your choice. For example [Remmina](https://remmina.org/) (installed by default on Ubuntu based distributions)
    </Message>
7. Enter the user name **Administrator** and the password, then click **Login**. The Windows desktop displays.
